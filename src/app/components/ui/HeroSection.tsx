          What started out as a little travel blog to keep friends and family
          up-to-date on our around the world trip has grown into something much
          bigger. This unexpected journey has been a life changing experience,
          not only for me, but also for Tim, Tyler, and Kara. If you have dreams
          of starting your own travel blog, or you just want to learn more about
          our story, fix yourself a cup of coffee (or a glass of wine ðŸ˜Š), sit
          back, and enjoy.
